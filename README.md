## Features
* The token employs some anti-whale and anti-bot features, by limiting transaction size according to current liquidity supply
* The token applies a 5% transaction fee that is sent to the liquidity pool from a burn address, making the coin both deflationary and unruggable
* The token also applies another 5% fee that is redistributed to holders, rewarding hodlers.
